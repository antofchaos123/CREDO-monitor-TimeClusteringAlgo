This documentation contains the informations regarding the use of the algorithm.
For the detailed description of the analysis, please refer to this link:

and the comments in the codes.

------------------HOW TO RUN THE ALGORITHM----------------------

Files: 
	-run.sh: contains the declaration of important parameters, compilation and execution of the two programs.

	-analysisMain.cpp: main analysis is contained in this file. As an input, it requires the multiplet value (fixed to 2 for the moment),\
	the user id and name, and the date at which the analysis is run.

	-plot4user.C: root macro to create a plot based on the output of the analysis.

Procedure:

The input file required for this analysis is a .txt file containing timestamps in second (UNIX time format) sorted in increasing values in one column.
This txt file must have the following format:
						timestamp_userID.txt

Once the parameters are set in run.sh, run the command 'run.sh'.
The output of analysisMain.cpp will be two files (three if you decide to pipe the terminal output in a txt file):

	-root file containing histrograms showing the distribution of test statistic and number of doublets for the scrambled maps

	-txt file containing the parameters necessary for the final plot
	-> each time the analysis is run, a new line is added, creating a new point for the plot with its x-coordinate given by the date at which the analysis
	was run.
	Each line shows:

	1/date	2/expected test statistic value (log10)	3/observed test statistic value (log10)	4/3 sigma limit for TS	5/5 sigma limit for TS	6/expected number of doublets	7/observed number of doublets	8/3 sigma limit for doublets	9/5 sigma limit for doublets

This txt file is used to obtain the test statistic and doublets plots with the root macro plot4user.C. The plots are saved as both .root and .png files.
